    description: "How hard can it be to pack for a walking holiday? Just a pair of sensible shoes and you're set, aren't you? Well...yes. And no.

This is what I take with me as I travel the world, staying in mostly hostels/hotels/airbnb-places/friend's-places/family's-places. I work as a freelance concept artist & illustrator, so I take everything I need to do my work, too."
