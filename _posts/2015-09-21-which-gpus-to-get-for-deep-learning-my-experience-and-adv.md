    description: "Intel and Micron have a new way to store data that they say is denser, tougher, and faster than the competition, and it's already starting production. In a live keynote today, the companies announced 3D Xpoint, a new category of non-volatile memory that claims to be 1,000 times faster than the NAND architecture underlying most flash memory cards and solid state drives."

    description: "The decade-long partnership between Intel and Micron to build better NAND (or Flash) memory used in solid-state drives has yielded an entirely new form of computer memory. This is a big deal. It's as if a 10-year effort by Ford and GM to build a better car also produced a Segway."

description: 'It is again and again amazing to see how much speedup you get when you use GPUs for deep learning: Compared to CPUs 10x speedups are typical, but on larger problems one can achieve 20x speedups. With GPUs you can try out new ideas, algorithms and experiments much faster than usual and get almost immediate feedback as to what works and what does not.'
