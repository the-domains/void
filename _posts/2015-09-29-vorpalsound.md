description: "Hi. After a while, I'm back with a new tutorial. This post's concept is really simple: A basic field recording, minimally edited with CDP, chopped up, and processed live inside Redux. But even such a modest setup can yield a lot of cool sounds, just by using fundamental processing techniques."
