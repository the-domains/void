<article style=""><h1>Image Based Relighting Using Neural Networks</h1><p>We present a neural network regression method for relighting realworld scenes from a small number of images&amp;period; The relighting in this work is formulated as the product of the scene's light transport matrix and new lighting vectors&amp;comma; with the light transport matrix reconstructed from the input images&amp;period;</p></article>
