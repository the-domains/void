<article style=""><h1>Building a Deep Learning &amp;lpar;Dream&amp;rpar; Machine</h1><p>As a PhD student in Deep Learning&amp;comma; as well as running my own consultancy&amp;comma; building machine learning products for clients I'm used to working in the cloud and will keep doing so for production-oriented systems&amp;sol;algorithms&amp;period; There are however huge drawbacks to cloud-based systems for more research oriented tasks where you mainly want to try out various algorithms and architectures&amp;comma; to iterate and move fast&amp;period;</p><img src="http://graphific.github.io/images/dlpc/1_building.jpg" /></article>
