description: 'Hello! When working on HTFE, I spend a lot of time dealing with how one properly creates SDRs (Sparse Distributed Representations, aka sparse codes) for inputs. I have recently created a semi-new method of generating sparse codes in a very fast manner that, to my knowledge, is biologically plausible.'
