            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>O Canto das Mulheres do Asfalto Estimad...</h1><p>O Canto das Mulheres do Asfalto Estimada Platéia. O Canto das Mulheres do Asfalto é uma peça onde as mulheres decidem não mais ter filhos. Mas não é luta de gênero não. Não é greve de sexo não.</p><img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/431b27cef4817d18bf2b2522b605641e/tumblr_nt3091ppH01udnmrqo1_500.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Torch | Recurrent Model of Visual Attention</h1><p>In this blog post, I want to discuss how we at Element-Research implemented the recurrent attention model (RAM) described in[1]. Not only were we able to reproduce the paper, but we also made of bunch of modular code available in the process. You can reproduce the RAM on the MNIST dataset using this training script.</p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torch/torch.github.io/master/blog/_posts/images/rva-diagram.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Building a Deep Learning (Dream) Machine</h1><p>As a PhD student in Deep Learning, as well as running my own consultancy, building machine learning products for clients I'm used to working in the cloud and will keep doing so for production-oriented systems/algorithms. There are however huge drawbacks to cloud-based systems for more research oriented tasks where you mainly want to try out various algorithms and architectures, to iterate and move fast.</p><img src="http://graphific.github.io/images/dlpc/1_building.jpg"></article>]]></description>
